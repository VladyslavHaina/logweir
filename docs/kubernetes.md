# Running Logweir on Kubernetes

v0.1 **does not require Kubernetes** — `logweir drill run` is a CLI that spawns
a local subprocess, and the demo runs on a laptop with `docker compose`. But a
scheduled drill is the point of the tool, and a `CronJob` is how most people
schedule one, so the facts below are part of the release rather than folklore.

Every fact on this page marked **verified** was checked on a live
`docker-desktop` cluster. Facts that were *not* checked live are marked
**unverified** and say so — please do not promote one to the other without
running it.

There is a worked manifest at [../examples/cronjob-drill.yaml](../examples/cronjob-drill.yaml).

---

## 1. The exit-code contract is nearly invisible in Kubernetes

This is the most important thing on the page, because it silently destroys the
signal Logweir exists to produce.

Logweir's exit codes are a published interface
([docs/stability.md](stability.md)):

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Pass. |
| 1 | Operational — the drill could not be attempted or continued. **No artifact was written.** |
| **2** | **A drill result that is not a pass. A scorecard WAS written and signed.** |
| 3 | Refused by a guard, before anything ran. |
| 4 | Signing or lock proof failed — and nothing was uploaded. |

**Exit 2 is the most valuable result the tool produces**: the drill ran, it was
measured, and your backup did not meet its objective. That is the finding you
scheduled the drill to get.

**Verified — and re-verified independently on 2026-09-05** with a job whose
container simply `exit 2`s: `kubectl get pods` showed `Error` with no code, the
Job's `.status` carried only `BackoffLimitExceeded`, and the exit code `2` was
readable at exactly one path. In Kubernetes the code appears only at —

```
pod.status.containerStatuses[].state.terminated.exitCode
```

(or `.lastState.terminated.exitCode` after a restart). It is **not** in Job
status, and `kubectl get pods` renders every non-zero exit as a generic
`Error`. So to an operator glancing at the namespace, **exit 2 is
indistinguishable from exit 1** — "your backup failed its drill" looks exactly
like "the drill could not run".

**The mitigation, verified working:**

```yaml
spec:
  backoffLimit: 0          # do not retry
  template:
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never # exactly one pod, one attempt
```

That yields **exactly one pod** (re-verified: `kubectl get pods -l job-name=... |
wc -l` returned 1), an immediate `Failed` Job condition, and a cleanly readable
exit code at the path above:

```bash
kubectl get pod -l job-name=<job> \
  -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.containerStatuses[0].state.terminated.exitCode}'
```

**The alternative is actively harmful, and worse than "buries the code".**
`restartPolicy: OnFailure` with `backoffLimit > 0` **retries a drill that
legitimately did not pass** — it runs your restore again, against the same
archive, expecting a different answer.

Re-verified on this machine's `docker-desktop` cluster on 2026-09-05, with a
job whose container simply `exit 2`s (`backoffLimit: 2`, `restartPolicy:
OnFailure`). What actually happened, in order:

```
Warning  BackOff               Back-off restarting failed container probe in pod ...
Normal   SuccessfulDelete      Deleted pod: logweir-onfailure-probe-79czs
Warning  BackoffLimitExceeded  Job has reached the specified backoff limit
```

The container was restarted **in place**, and then the job controller
**DELETED THE POD**. `kubectl get pods` afterwards: `No resources found`. Since
the exit code lives only on the pod object, **it is not buried in `lastState` —
it is gone**, and the Job records only `BackoffLimitExceeded`. A drill that
found a real problem leaves behind no evidence of which problem it was.

Do not use `OnFailure` for a drill.

**Unverified:** `podFailurePolicy` (GA) supports exit-code-specific Job actions
and would express "code 2 is a real result, do not retry; code 1 may be
retried" declaratively. It was **not** tested live and is recorded here as an
option to evaluate, not as a recommendation.

## 2. The engine image is linux/amd64 only

**Verified.** Upstream publishes `osodevops/kafka-backup` for **linux/amd64
only**; no arm64 manifest exists for any tag. On an arm64 node it runs under
emulation, but **only after a host-side pre-pull**:

```bash
docker pull --platform linux/amd64 osodevops/kafka-backup@sha256:8ff5be…
```

Kubelet-side pulling fails with `no matching manifest`. Two consequences:

- **Use `imagePullPolicy: Never`.** A missing pre-pull then fails legibly as
  `ErrImageNeverPull` rather than as an opaque pull error. This is the honest
  trade: the pod cannot fetch what it needs, so make it say so.
- **Never set `nodeSelector: kubernetes.io/arch: amd64`** on a single-arm64-node
  cluster. The pod stays `Pending` **forever**, with no event that names the
  real problem.

**Verified, and it will bite you later:** `docker image prune` evicts the
pre-pulled image, and drills silently start failing with **no code change and no
manifest change**. If drills stop working after a routine Docker cleanup, this
is why.

## 3. Registry, permissions and mounts

All **verified** on `docker-desktop`:

- **No registry is needed.** Docker Desktop's kubelet shares the local Docker
  image store, so a locally built `logweir:v0.1.0` is directly runnable.
- **The default ServiceAccount has zero access.** A drill pod needs its own
  ServiceAccount, Role and RoleBinding. `automountServiceAccountToken: false` is
  appropriate for v0.1, which makes no Kubernetes API calls at all.
- **The signing key mounts cleanly as a Secret file**, and the drill spec, the
  approval and the allowed-clusters list mount as a ConfigMap.
- **`emptyDir` is verified** for the engine's scratch directory. **No PVC was
  exercised.** The only StorageClass on the test cluster was `hostpath`.

## 4. What the pod still needs from you

The container image carries the engine; the environment does not carry itself:

| Variable | Why |
|---|---|
| `LOGWEIR_ENGINE_BIN` | Set by the image to `/usr/local/bin/kafka-backup`. Override only if you mount an engine elsewhere. |
| `LOGWEIR_ENGINE_VERSION`, `LOGWEIR_ENGINE_DIGEST` | **Mandatory.** An empty value is refused with exit 1: a signed scorecard must name the engine image that produced the restore. |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` / `AWS_REGION`, or an IRSA / Pod Identity setup | `object_store`'s own credential chain — **not** the AWS SDK's. `~/.aws/credentials`, `AWS_PROFILE` and SSO are unsupported. See [stability.md](stability.md). |
| `TMPDIR` | Where the rendered `restore.yaml` and the restore checkpoint land. Point it at a writable volume; the checkpoint is pod-local and is never uploaded, so a crashed restore is not resumable in v0.1. |

## 5. What is NOT here in v0.1

Stated so nobody goes looking:

- **No operator, no CRDs.** `weirkeeper`, `logweir.dev/v1alpha1`, `RestoreDrill`
  and `MetadataSnapshot` are SP5.
- **No Kubernetes Job execution of the engine.** v0.1 spawns a local
  subprocess inside the drill pod; it does not create a Job of its own.
- **No namespace-label segregation proof.** v0.1 proves the target is a scratch
  cluster with a **marker topic**, because a guard that needs a kubeconfig
  cannot run in the unit suite.
- **No `SubjectAccessReview`-verified approval.** Approval is a DSSE-signed
  document checked against the approver's public key.
- **No HTTP surface.** No `/metrics`, `/healthz` or `/readyz`. Metrics are a
  Prometheus **textfile** written at `--metrics-file` and scraped through
  node_exporter's textfile collector; see [../dashboards/logweir.json](../dashboards/logweir.json).
